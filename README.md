# Pandas Challenge

## Description
This project contains my work for the Pandas Challenge for the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp.  The project includes a Jupyter Notebook file which reads data from two csv files in the Resources folder.
These two files contain student and school data for a school district.  The data is read from the files and stored into one large data frame.  From here, several tables are generated to summarize
the performance of different schools in the school district.  The Jupyter Notebook file contains a description of the analytical methods as well as an analysis of the data.

## Contributors
Starter code for the Jupyter Notebook and the two csv files were provdied by the Data Analytics Bootcamp.  Code not provided by the Bootcamp was created entirely by Sam Lind.
